# Grailtopia's next steps ... Grailmeter

If your like me, I am in a mad dash to gather all of my personal data in an effort to create insight for my own life in a few key areas: Personal Finance, Health, and even metrics of hobbies can be easily flipped into cool personal dashboards with meaningful data.
<br /> <br />
In the case of Grailtopia, I think there is a potential market for replicating well known music tracking features that come out at the end of the year into a physical media tracker. We all have heard of the two big players in the arena -- Spotify Wrapped and Apple Replay. And with the solid foundation of source code that can be extended from here, I think my discogs-helper API is the perfect means to creating an application of physical media tracking.

This is not meant to be a consumer application by any means, this is a matter of personal function that not only my friends but I also think can be easily "Set and Forget" leading to data collection whenever spinning vinyl at home. I have already created the bones for how this can be viewed on a daily basis. This is by no means a final product, but I think lays the foundation for a well designed model that can be leveraged in order to track vinyl plays.
